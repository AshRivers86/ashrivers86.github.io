James Bledsoe jgbledsoe1@my.waketech.edu

2.	A brief description of your Github account

This will be my Wake Tech Student Repository.

3.	A brief description of the repository you created

I'll be using this repository for assignments in the future when necessary.

4.	A brief description of the steps you took to clone the repository onto your local machine.

I followed the steps listed in GitHub Assignment.docx. After creating an account, I downloaded the 64bit version of the software which doesn't match the descriptions in the
.docx file because certain icons are not listed there. Once I installed GitHub Desktop, I cloned the repository by clicking "Add" which was probably a "+" icon before. I
saved the clone to My Documents which is the default path.
